We report Raman sideband cooling(RSC) of a single sodium atom to its three-dimensional
motional ground state in an optical tweezer and demonstrate that this is possible
even without tight confinement and low initial temperature.
Our approach is general and applicable to other systems.
Extending RSC beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime opens the possibility
for ground state cooling of systems such as light atoms and
molecules that can be laser-cooled.
