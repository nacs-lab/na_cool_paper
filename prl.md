We report Raman sideband cooling beyond the so-called Lamb-Dicke regime
where all previous work lies.
Our techniques open a route to ground-state cooling of systems such as light atoms
and laser-cooled polar molecules where high trapping frequency
and low initial thermal occupation are so far hard to achieve.
Ground-state cooling in those systems are important to realize long coherence time
in future quantum applications.
Our specific demonstration using single sodium atoms allows such a system to serve
as an interesting source for quantum assembling of complex system,
such as ultracold polar molecules or coherent atom arrays.
