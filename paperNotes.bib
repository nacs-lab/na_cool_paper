@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="The final hyperfine state sensitive detection employs a strong beam that is resonant with the $F=2$ to $F'=3$ cycling transition, to heat the $F=2$ population out of the trap. Therefore, any atoms which survive this heat out procedure are interpreted as having been in the $F=1$ state."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We find a reduction in the scattering rate by a factor of $130(20)$, as compared to using an OP resonant with $3^2P_{3/2}$, from which the $|2, 2>$ state could always scatter a photon via the excited $|F'=3, m_{F'}=3>$ state."}
