We believe the limitation are all technical.
From the numerical simulation,
we can show that without off-resonant scattering from the Raman beams or other technical source
of decoherence, greater than 99% ground state occupation probability is achievable.

Better performance when reducing off-resonance scattering.

Still need to figure out about the fluctuation....

The effect of the optical potential is eliminated by switching the trap out of phase
with the cooling light. The performance of molasses cooling is therefore not affected
and does not interfere with the Raman cooling.

The loss of the atom is likely caused by the same issues that limits our cooling performance
together with a sequence that is longer than optimal. We have shown that by reducing
the off-resonance scattering and shortening the sequence the atom loss can be eliminated.
